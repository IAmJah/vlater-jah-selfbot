# DiscordSelfbot
A discord raid/utility selfbot coded in python. This is a rewrite of my old selfbot, vlaterultis.

**Before running make sure to fill out the info at the top of the code (token and prefix)**

# Setting prefix and token
Your token is how the bot will connect to your account. You'll have to paste it in the quotations. For help getting your token, dm me vlater#1000

*Example:*
```py
token = "Njyyauush7445abd-==y.iiaji.87hd-mnjdfjjb=djnjhhsf"
```

The prefix will also need to be placed in the quotations. This is how the bot knows you're running a command.

*Example:*
```py
prefix = "&"
```

# Commands
Commands are as follows:

> help: Shows a full list of commands.
> 
> chanclear: Purges your messages in the command channel.
> 
> msgedit: Edits all you messages in a channel.
>
> userinfo: Gets the info of all users mentioned after the command and sends in chat as a text file.
> 
> spam: Spams a message in chat.Your token is how the bot will connect to your account. You'll have to paste it in the quotations.
> 
> gspam: Ghost spams messages in chat.
> 
> rspam: Ghost spams a list of all roles.
> 
> nuke: Nukes the server.
>
> logout: Logs out of the client.

All commands will use your prefix before the actual command (e.g. &logout). Make sure to check back for any updates, I'm going to try to update this every once in a while.

# *Enjoy!*
